<p class="cap">For the prevention of <span class="smcap">Juvenile Depravity</span>, and
the consequent diminution of the heavy Burthens cast,
first, upon private Individuals by numerous petty Thefts,
and lastly, upon the County by the oft repeated Arrests,
Examinations, Committals, Prosecutions, and Imprisonments
of <span class="smcap">Juvenile Offenders</span>.</p>

<p>For many years the public mind has been trained to
believe that an improved Prison Discipline was the Panacea
for the prevention of crime, and it is only necessary to point
to that valuable and most excellent Institution at Parkhurst
to shew how earnestly (<em>so far as regards Juvenile Delinquency</em>)
men of the first Station and the first Talent of the day,
seconded by the powerful aid of the Legislature have devoted
themselves to the subject, for it is impossible for an enlightened
statesman to view the deeply-dyed depravity which exists
among the Children of the lower orders, and not feel that no
Government deserves the proud title of a <em>Paternal Government</em>
that can allow such a state of things to continue, if
any remedy can be suggested.</p>

<p>The opinions which I have ever held on this subject have
remained unaltered amidst all the various changes that have
taken place in the Public mind, on the subject of Prison
Discipline, the degrading home Slavery of the Hulks, and
the awful severance of all natural ties by transportation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
distant climes. I have ever held all these to be ineffectual
for the purpose of raising the moral standard of a great
Nation, and still more ineffectual in promoting that social
and domestic happiness which ought to be the bond of
Union of an enlightened and Christian People. Nevertheless,
I have not hesitated to put my shoulder to the wheel, and
have laboured hard to improve our system of Prison Discipline,
believing that we shall always have criminals to deal
with, but deeply impressed also with the conviction that it is
more consistent with the views of Christianity and common
sense, that our exertions should be directed to the prevention
of crime, especially among the young, than to the correction
of criminals, who have been allowed by our present system
to become enured to the commission of it.</p>

<p>A most interesting investigation which I have been lately
carrying on as a Visiting Justice of the House of Correction
at Cold Bath Fields, justifies me in predicting that when
more is done to prevent crime than to punish it, our labours
to diminish the burthens on the county purse will be crowned
with far happier results than any we can now present to
public view for the purpose of obtaining public support.
From the Investigation before alluded to, it is evident that
the want of proper parental care and the absence of domestic
comforts are the two by far most fruitful and most manifest
springs from which flows one vast tide of Juvenile Depravity
and Crime, though let it not be supposed for a moment that
these two springs cannot still further be traced to one deep
seated source which might with God’s assistance be speedily
dried up; but the public mind is not yet prepared for this
discovery, and we must be content to deal with the two main
springs of crime to which I have alluded, until the public
mind is more enlightened on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>The recent Establishment of Baths and Wash-Houses for
the Working Classes, and the efforts lately made to provide
suitable and comfortable dwellings for the Poor, show that
the current of public opinion is fast waking up to the paramount
importance of domestic comforts to secure social
happiness. Without them, <span class="smcap">Home</span> (that otherwise Magic
word) can have no charms, for either the old or the young,
and they are induced to seek pleasure abroad among the
countless temptations of sin and depravity. Nothing can be
more faithfully or more graphically depicted than the character
and occupations of the young Thief of our great Towns,
given by my excellent Friend and worthy colleague, Mr.
Buchanan in his <cite>Remarks on the causes and state of “Juvenile
crime in the Metropolis,”</cite>—but the remedy he proposes, falls
far short I fear of what would be required to effect his purpose;
and as I differ from him in some of the most prominent
features of his plan, I am induced to follow his example and
place my views before my brother Justices in a printed form
for their consideration, in the hope that others will do the
same, and that out of our various suggestions some practicable
plan may be formed to meet the crying Evil which all
admit, but for which so few seem prepared to suggest a
remedy, and which has now become of such magnitude as to
elicit universal and repeated complaints from Judges, and
Juries, Justices, and Magistrates, and all concerned in the
administration of our Criminal Laws.</p>

<p>It is in vain that the resources of the Government and
Talents of its Executive are taxed to improve the condition
and management of our penal settlements. To the young
Minister entering for the first time on the duties of a colonial
Secretary, the difficulties which this department of his
office presents must be truly appalling, while he must feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
that the present state of some of our penal settlements is a
disgrace to civilized humanity—Has not money and talent
enough been yet expended without adequate results to convince
the Government (to use a homely Yorkshire phrase) that
“<em>they have got hold of the wrong end of the stick</em>?” The
present system is to allow a youth to become well hardened
in villainy before he is transported. He is maintained alternately
by the plunder of the public out of prison, and by
the county purse in prison at a great expense for years; and
after multiplied convictions for every grade of offence, from
the trifling assault to the Highway Robbery and Mid-night
Burglary, running through the mazes of every yard in the
Gaol, carefully imparting into each the infamous tact, guilty
ingenuity, and foul associations, slang language and wicked
passions of the others, thus setting at naught all the carefully
defined, and law enacted rules of what I have ever deemed to
be under such circumstances, miscalled classification, he is
at length deemed a worthy subject for Transportation, and is
sent out to our penal colonies to form one of a community so
depraved and degraded that, in moments of calm consideration,
one is shocked at the means necessarily there resorted
to, to make it manageable at all. A stupendous difficulty to
the Executive abroad and a constant source of painful contemplation
to the Government at home. Surely when we
are driven by the earnest and justifiable remonstrances of our
hard working colonists, who can no longer bear the constant
infusion of such a polluted stream of Emigration among
their industrious population, to found a new Colony in
North Australia, at an enormous outlay, it would be wise
to consider if a much less expense properly incurred at home
might not effect far better results and be more like “<em>getting
hold of the right end of the stick</em>.” It must be an obvious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and admitted fact that old offenders for the most part rise
from the ranks of Juvenile Depredators, and to cut off the
supply to the former from the latter class would undoubtedly
be striking at the root of the evil, and which might be
done at home, where we can get at it conveniently instead of
dealing with the branches many thousands of miles off,
and at every possible disadvantage in Van Diemen’s Land
and Norfolk Island. Surely, then, common sense points
out that all our efforts should be directed to stay the plague
of Juvenile depravity at home; and before I venture to suggest
a means of accomplishing this Herculean task, let me
ask three plain and simple questions—</p>

<p>1st. Has the Ministry of the Gospel the proper and
divinely appointed instrument for the eradication of all sin,
through the enforcement of Principles destructive of the love
of all sin, been effectual for the purpose? Manifestly not.</p>

<p>2nd. Has education as now conducted, tho’ undoubtedly
a great boon to the poorer classes, and poured upon them
in 10,000 streams from the benevolent fountain of charity
been effectual for the purpose? Manifestly not.</p>

<p>3rd. Has an improved Prison Discipline with its enlightened
committees of Visiting Justices and Prison Inspectors,
and its piles of Parliamentary Enactments been
effectual for the purpose? Manifestly not.</p>

<p>The present agitated state of public feeling on the subject
of Juvenile Crime and Juvenile Criminals loudly proclaims
that no other answer can be given to these questions, and we
are therefore not only justified, but actually called upon by
the hallowed voice of Religion and of common Humanity,
to seek some new remedy for the acknowledged evil. We
must neither be alarmed by the novelty of such remedy, nor
deterred by its cost if it has common sense for its foundation,
and practicability in its details. And now for the remedy I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
would propose.</p>

<p>I should certainly not have ventured to follow on the footsteps
of my able friend Mr. Buchanan so closely, by printing
and circulating my views on the subject if our plans had not
so widely differed in most essential features; but this being
the case I am anxious that our views should be in the hands
of our Brother Justices as nearly at the same time as possible,
so that our discussions in the committee which has been
appointed to consider of the subject of Juvenile Offenders
may extend over both plans, and that the Committee may be
the better enabled to decide between them.</p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan does not contemplate any legislative Interference—I
contend that nothing effectual can be done without
it—Mr. Buchanan looks to the County Rate for the means
which, however, unfortunately is not available for the purpose.
I look to the Treasury—Mr. Buchanan proposes a withdrawal
from contaminating Association only during the day—I propose
an entire separation day and night from all bad
Companions—and lastly Mr. Buchanan’s is a voluntary
System—mine a compulsory one.</p>

<p>Having thus drawn attention generally to these marked
differences between the two plans, I will now proceed to
develope my own in the firm conviction that it would be found
both effectual and practicable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I propose that a bill should be passed by the Legislature,
the Preamble of which should in effect state, that the fearful
extent of Juvenile Depravity and Crime in the Metropolitan
Districts and in large and populous Towns requires generally
immediate Interference on the part of the Legislature.—That
the great causes of the said Juvenile Depravity and Crime
appear to be the absence of proper Parental or Friendly care,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and the absence of a comfortable home, and that all Children
above the age of 7 and under the age of 15 years suffering
from either of these causes require protection to prevent their
getting into bad company, learning idle and dissolute habits,
growing up in ignorance and becoming an expence and
burthen on the Country as Criminals, and that such
protection should be afforded by the state.</p>

<p>I propose that the various clauses of the Act should enact
as follows—</p>

<p>I. That an Asylum for unprotected and destitute Children
be founded by the Government to be called the <span class="smcap">Child’s
Home</span>.</p>

<p>II. That Commissioners be appointed to manage such
Asylum.</p>

<p>III. That provision be made in such Asylum for instructing
Children in all useful arts, trades and occupations
suitable to the working classes.</p>

<p>IV. That unprotected and destitute children shall be
deemed to include all children above 7 and under 15 years
of age under the following circumstances,—Children driven
from their homes by the bad conduct of Parents—Children
neglected by their Parents—Children who are Orphans and
neglected by their friends—Children who are Bastards, and
children who are Orphans, and have no one to protect them or
provide for them, or for whom no one does provide—Children
who from their own misconduct have no protection or
provision found them—Children who are idle or dissolute,
and whose Parents or Friends cannot controul their bad
conduct—Children who are destitute of proper food, clothing,
or education owing to the poverty of their parents or friends,
but whose parents or friends do not apply for, or receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
parish relief—Children who are destitute for want of employment,
and children of the class which become Juvenile
Offenders generally.</p>

<p>V. That any such Child as aforesaid may be brought before
any Two Justices of the Peace by any Constable or other
peace Officer or by any Overseer of the poor or other parish
Officer and evidence on oath being given to the satisfaction
of such Justices that the Child is one of either of the classes
enumerated in the foregoing clause, such Justices may sign
an order for the admission of the Child into the Asylum.</p>

<p>VI. That when in the Asylum if not claimed or redeemed
as hereinafter provided, the Children shall be subject to be
dealt with as the state thinks proper, to serve as Sailors or
Soldiers or Workmen in public works, or as Artificers or
Tradesmen, or as Household Servants, or as and wherever
the state may require.</p>

<p>VII. That on a Child being admitted into the Asylum,
enquiry shall be made by the Commissioners as to the
circumstances of the Parents or other persons now by law
bound to support the said Child, and if found able to support,
or to contribute to the support of the said Child, the Justices
sending the said Child to the Asylum may make orders from
time to time for any amount of contribution to be paid, for
or towards the support of the said Child in the said Asylum.</p>

<p>VIII. That such sums be collected for the use of the Asylum
by the Overseer or Rate Collectors of the Parish where the
persons on whom the order is made reside, and that power
be given to attach the property of such persons, or wages in
the hands of Masters, or due from Masters of such persons,
in cases of working people or servants, to satisfy the amount
named in such order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>IX. That all Children sent to the said Asylum be taught
several useful Trades, Arts or Occupations, besides the usual
education of Reading, Writing and Arithmetic.</p>

<p>X. That if at any time any Parent or Friend should
be able and willing to afford proper Protection and Employment
for any Child in the said Asylum, subject to the
approbation of Two Justices the Child may be permitted to
leave the Asylum on such Parent or Friend’s paying a sum
to be settled by the Commissioners of the Asylum for
such Permission.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One general Feeling which any suggestion for the taking
of Children away from parental care usually creates is, that
it will be immediately abused by unfeeling Parents wishing
to get rid of the burthen of maintaining their Offspring, but
it is conceived that the plan of taxing the Parents or Relatives
for their maintenance in the Asylum as provided in the 7th
and 8th clauses will be an adequate check for the prevention
of any such abuse, while the Children becoming valuable by
the sort of useful Education that is given them, will no
doubt induce many a Parent to seek the means of getting
their Children home again to assist by their valuable labour
in support of the Family. We know perfectly well that the
first years of a Boy’s Apprenticeship are never spent in really
learning the Trade he is apprenticed to learn, he is used by
his Master as an errand boy, a servant, a groom, or even
doing house work for some years in many cases before he
begins to learn his Trade, and why? because if he learned
his Trade at once, he would become so valuable that he could
easily get work for himself, and so impatient to work upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
his own account that he would be sure to run away before
his time was up. We know by our experience in the House
of Correction at Cold Bath Fields, that a boy may be made
an excellent Shoemaker in Twelve Months, and that he might
be made an equally good Tailor in an equally short time,
admits of no doubt, while the business of a Tinman, a
Shoeing Smith, a Painter, and an hundred others are learned
with similar facility. Each Child taught a few of these useful
Arts, instead of being a burthen upon, would be a valuable
addition to a Family. I know I shall be told that the
difficulty of providing for these Children however well taught,
will be almost insuperable, and I shall see Parkhurst pointed
at as a great example of this sad truth. It is in fact no
example for me. There all the Children <em>have been criminals</em>,
have been allowed to drink deeply of the cup of vice, and if
not after trial, have at any rate before trial been subject to
the, I may say almost electrical, contamination of Gaol
Association, so rapidly does it take effect. There the foul
impress of Felony or Misdemeanour is stamped upon them
all before they are offered to the Public as useful members of
Society. The Children of the Asylum will be of a far different
class. They will be taken before the actual commission of
crime has been brought home to them, when surrounded by
want destitution and injustice from the poverty or drunkenness
or depravity of those who should be, but are not, their
natural protectors, they would inevitably have fallen a prey
to those who are ever on the look out for just such suffering
creatures to make them, though only yet half willing, the
tools of practiced crime; to become, when further advanced
in sin, hardened and emboldened in Iniquity, and thus
proper Candidates for Parkhurst.</p>

<p>The Experiment has never been tried of <span class="allsmcap">A STATE</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">PROVISION</span> <em>for innocent, but destitute and unprotected Children</em>,
nor of a compulsory payment from the parent for <em>the proper
maintenance and education of his Child</em>. I must not be told
therefore of Refuges and Magdalens and Schools of Industry
and Philanthropic Societies and Provisions for Poor criminals
on their release from prison, or of any results which have
followed on their adoption, as reasons why my plan should
not be tried, they are no examples for this purpose. I am
satisfied from a long experience in such matters, that no
difficulty would be found in placing out boys well taught, well
brought up, under rules of strict discipline, and who have
not yet become criminals. The expense of maintaining them
as innocent children will be far less than that of maintaining
them as felons while we shall be destroying the root
of this Upas Tree which stands in the midst of every
densely populated Neighbourhood, spreading its branches so
far in every direction that the good and virtuous even can
at length reach them, and think they are destroying the tree
by endeavouring to keep its unwieldly limbs within bounds
by the pruning knife. A most fatal error!</p>

<p>How much longer will the overburthened Ratepayers endure
to see a drunken Father earning from 30 to 50 shillings a
week (and there are thousands of such) turn into the Gin Palace
or the Beer Shop with his hard earned wages on the Saturday
Night to spend it all in strong drink and debauchery.
How much longer will that Ratepayer be content to lose
from his unguarded Stall, or it may be even his well watched
Premises, the petty Articles which the starving Children of
that drinking sot are purposely sent out to steal to appease
the craving of unsatisfied hunger? How much longer will
that Ratepayer be content to pay the enormous sums which
are daily drawn from his too often slender resources to pay
the heavy cost of the repeated apprehensions by the Police,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
examinations, remands, re-examinations, and committals by
the Magistrates and Justices, Trials and Convictions by
Juries, Sentences by Judges, and Imprisonments in our
Gaols of those wretched Children? How much longer will
intelligent Juries, men not only of common sense, but of
common humanity, continue to present the state of Juvenile
Depravity, and the mode of disposing of Juvenile Depredators
as unsatisfactory and inhuman, and be satisfied to see
nothing done on either subject in the way even of an effort
to improve? How much longer will the Ministers who rule
this great nation, be they of what politics or what party they
may, remain deaf to the thousand tongues that are daily
proclaiming that nothing has yet met the hourly increasing
evils of Juvenile depravity, and not make some bold attempt
to meet the difficulty in some new form and in some incipient
stage less appalling than that which idleness and destitution
present when matured into vice and depravity? It must be
remembered that the Children with whom I propose to deal
are the very same beings who are now dealt with by the state
under the far more expensive character of criminals, and the
simple question in the case as a matter of finance will be
whether it would be more expensive to maintain any given
number of innocent Children, and educate them as I propose
they should be educated, than to capture, try, and maintain
an equal number of Adult Felons at home and abroad at the
enormous cost at which they are now dealt with. No one
could for a moment doubt that the balance would be greatly
in favor of the new plan now suggested, if considered only
as a financial one; but in every other point of view how far
more desirable must it be to prevent than to punish crime?
To change the system of education among the working
classes, and instead of teaching them to arrive at an excellence
in Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic, which only makes them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
seek places above that which Nature destined them to fulfil,
to have them taught those useful Arts which they can employ
in every situation of their humble station in Society, learning
to Read and Write, and keep accounts merely as ancillary to
those useful trades and occupations by which they are to get
their living, and so to add to the general stock of comfort
and happiness among their fellows. To stop the wages in the
hands of the employer which an abandoned and depraved
Mechanic would squander on his own ruin, and disburse it
for him on the legitimate object of maintaining and properly
educating his own offspring. In a word to dry up the springs
of Juvenile depravity at their source, instead of endeavouring
to deal with the raging flood of Crime, which experience has
long taught us when once abroad sweeps away with resistless
force every barrier which finite wisdom has ever yet suggested
for arresting its awful progress.</p>

<p>This consideration alone should induce us not hastily to
condemn any suggestion, however novel or gigantic it may at
first sight appear, and will I trust gain from my Brother
Justices of Middlesex for my humble endeavour, in what I
consider the greatest field for exertion ever opened to the
Philanthropist, a few moments Investigation of a plan which,
however soon a better may supersede it, is the result of many
years of anxious Enquiry and careful investigation, and which
I am prepared to show involves no principle which has not
been previously acknowledged and acted upon by the
Legislature.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
